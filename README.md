# 🚁 MINI COPTER

**Mini Copter** is a flappy-style arcade game where you guide a tiny helicopter through rows of tall buildings.  
The controls are simple, but the challenge increases the longer you survive.  
With dynamic day–night transitions, rising speed, and a unique shield mechanic, Mini Copter brings a refreshing twist to a classic formula.

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

- Tap/click/press to make the helicopter rise  
- Release to let it fall  
- Avoid crashing into buildings  
- Survive as long as possible and aim for the highest score  

The game starts slow and calm—but don’t be fooled.  
As your score rises, the speed increases gradually… and eventually becomes *fast and intense*.

## 🛡️ Shield Mechanic (Unique Twist)

Unlike traditional flappy-style games, **Mini Copter** introduces a special Shield power-up:

- A shield appears randomly during gameplay  
- Touch it to gain a protective barrier  
- With the shield active, you can crash into **one** building without dying  
- After breaking through the obstacle, the shield disappears and the run continues  

This feature helps create exciting “last second saves” that keep the game unpredictable and fun.

## 🌗 Dynamic Backgrounds: Day & Night

Every **5 points**, the background switches between **day** and **night**, giving each run a visually dynamic feel.  
The changing atmosphere also marks your progress as difficulty increases.
